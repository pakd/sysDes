> APIs or Low Level Design
* Web Sockets as they are bi-directional or duplex, anyone can initiate communication unlike http which is based on request and response model.

* check online or last seen or offline
	* Redis (user, server, last_heartbeat) e.g. (userA, N1, 17/03/2019:20:02:40), (userB, N2, 17/03/2019:19:02:40)
	* Last heartbeat can be used to find last seen (curr_time - last_heartbeat)
	* Similarly offline or online (( curr_time - last_heartbeat) < 5mins  = online)
	
* Send or receive message
	* If both users are active and socket is open directly send or receive message
	* If reciever is offline, store message in DB (equivalent to msg sent)

	* If receiver comes online, send acknowledgement to sender or move message to read table (equivalent to msg read)

* Group chat - same as one to one chat but instead of user table make group table which has list of all users in the group.

* History 
	* Take few day's data, compress and store to cdn/blob storage and store url in conversation table
